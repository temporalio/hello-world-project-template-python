This is the Hello World project which has all the basic files explained in our [Hello World Tutorial](https://learn.temporal.io/getting_started/python/hello_world_in_python//).

## Instructions

Ensure you have Python 3.7 or later installed locally, and that you have Docker installed to run the Temporal Cluster.

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/temporalio/hello-world-project-template-python
```

Switch to the cloned directory:

hello-world-project-template-python
```

Create a virtual environment for your project and install the Temporal SDK:

```bash
python3 -m venv env
